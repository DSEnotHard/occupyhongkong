Occupy Hong Kong: Macro scale, micro-adaptations
=========

I was small part of the Occupy Wall Street movement (working to help stock the kitchen and First Aid tents in Zuccotti Park), so I had a sense of what [Occupy Central with Love and Peace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Central_with_Love_and_Peace), the Hong Kong movement to insist on [the democracy they were promised](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_electoral_reform), would look like.

And I was wrong.

I arrived in Hong Kong yesterday, and this morning I went over to Central. At first, the scale of the event seemed like Occupy in New York -- hundreds of people occupying a public space. Walking uphill on the massive thoroughfare, now turned into a political pedestrian mall, felt like a kind of elongated Zuccotti Park. And then I got to the crest of the roadway, and looked down towards the Admiralty neighborhood, the moment captured in the picture above. 

This movement is absolutely massive, operating at a scale I have never seen in an occupation, endless participation as far as the eye can see.
