Occupy Hong Kong: Macro scale, micro-adaptations
=========

I was small part of the Occupy Wall Street movement (working to help stock the kitchen and First Aid tents in Zuccotti Park), so I had a sense of what [Occupy Central with Love and Peace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Central_with_Love_and_Peace), the Hong Kong movement to insist on [the democracy they were promised](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_electoral_reform), would look like.

And I was wrong.

I arrived in Hong Kong yesterday, and this morning I went over to Central. At first, the scale of the event seemed like Occupy in New York -- hundreds of people occupying a public space. Walking uphill on the massive thoroughfare, now turned into a political pedestrian mall, felt like a kind of elongated Zuccotti Park. And then I got to the crest of the roadway, and looked down towards the Admiralty neighborhood, the moment captured in the picture above. 

This movement is absolutely massive, operating at a scale I have never seen in an occupation, endless participation as far as the eye can see.

I took my kids with me, and while I have never lost my midwesterner's wonder at big cities, they were raised in New York City and now live in Shanghai, so crowds don't phase them much. What they focussed on (and what came to interest me) were the ways that the occupation is rapidly adapting to the need to inhabit a two mile stretch of asphalt 24/7. 

The first thing we noticed was the need to decorate, to take impersonal space and say "We're here. This matters." Cities are occupied, every day, by their residents. To make an occupation different, to kick off a political conversation, requires taking urban-scale space and adding human scale messages.
