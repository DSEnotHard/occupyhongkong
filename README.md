Occupy Hong Kong: Macro scale, micro-adaptations
=========

I was small part of the Occupy Wall Street movement (working to help stock the kitchen and First Aid tents in Zuccotti Park), so I had a sense of what [Occupy Central with Love and Peace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Central_with_Love_and_Peace), the Hong Kong movement to insist on [the democracy they were promised](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Hong_Kong_electoral_reform), would look like.

I arrived in Hong Kong yesterday, and this morning I went over to Central, the main street through Hong Kong's financial district. At first, the scale of the event seemed like Occupy in New York -- hundreds of people occupying a public space. Walking uphill on Central, now turned into a political pedestrian mall, felt like a kind of elongated Zuccotti Park. And then I got to the crest of the roadway, and looked down towards the Admiralty neighborhood, the moment captured in the picture above. 

And I realized how wrong I was about the scale being like New York. This movement is absolutely massive, operating at a scale I have never seen in an occupation, endless participation as far as the eye can see. (This seemed to be a common reaction -- my picture includes several other people holding up their cameras at about the same spot, having had roughly the same reaction.)

I took my kids with me, and while I have never lost my midwesterner's wonder at big cities, we've raised in New York City and now in Shanghai, so crowds don't impress them much. What they focussed on (and what came to interest me) were the ways that the occupation is rapidly adapting to the need to inhabit a two mile stretch of asphalt 24/7. 

The first thing we noticed was the need to decorate, to take impersonal space and say "We're here. This matters." Cities are occupied, every day, by their residents. To make an occupation different, to kick off a political conversation in what had just been a transportation corridor, requires taking urban-scale space and adding human-scale adaptations.

Because the first clash of the protest involved occupiers defending themselves against pepper spray with umbrellas, this has become known as the Umbrella Movement. Since Hong Kong is, per Wikipedia, "a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate", umbrellas are ubiquitous; politicizing them provides some of the [hiding in plain sight](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/a-tale-of-two-memes-the-powerful-connection-between-trayvon-martin-and-chen-guangcheng/259604/) politicization that An Xiao Mina has written about so brilliantly. It also means that political symbols are readily for sale in a country known for subtle and pervasive symbolic control.

Even broken umbrellas can serve a second, rhetorical function. Tied the the western-most barricade on Central, the umbrellas say "This is where business as usual stops and our particular temporary autonomous zone starts."

An array of donated umbrellas looks like a combination of a yard sale and an armory.

The occupation doesn't go in for political graffiti -- most signs are made and put up, rather than being painted directly onto walls. (Indeed, we saw protestors carefully scrubbing graffiti off the roadway today, an elaborate signal that this movement does not aim to destroy or deface.)

My friend Marianne Manilov pointed out to me that Occupy Wall Street matched its political messages with a commitment to look after anyone who showed up. In the industrialized world, taking care of other people has become a radical political act. The occupiers of Hong Kong have created an impromptu but effective distribution system for food, water, first aid, cooling supplies.
